# touchbarpicker
A TouchBar colorpicker version

This project is based on Electron and is for OSX with a touchbar.
if you don't have a touchbar, you can download [touchbar-emulator](https://github.com/sindresorhus/touch-bar-simulator).

### Note
This project is a compact and minified version of my [Colorpicker](https://github.com/toinane/colorpicker) app.

## Download
- 1.0.0 Version : [download](https://github.com/Toinane/touchbarpicker/releases/tag/1.0.0)

## How to use
- Install & launch app
- Click the icon app
- You should have buttons on your touchbar

When you change the color, the hexadecimal code will be copied in your clipboard :)
